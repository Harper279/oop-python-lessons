# typecasting: the process of converting a variable from one data type to another
# for example, when converting an integer to a float it turns from 25 to 25.0(int to float) or in reverse: 5.2 to 5(float to int)

#name = "bro"
#age = 25
#gpa = 5.1
#is_student = True

#print(type(gpa))                #the terminal shows: when print(type(name))  <class 'str'>      because name = "bro" is a string, this happens with the rest of the variables

#age = float(age)               # converting the integer to a float

#print(age)             #output is 25.0

#name = bool(name)          # converting the str to a bool

#print(name)                # output: True#
